# GeneNetwork2 deployment (in Memphis)

This (private) repository contains the configuration files, scripts
and documentation for deployment of GN2.

## Introduction

GN2 and all dependencies are installed via GNU Guix.

Installation of GN2 is documented in the genenetwork2
[repository](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/blob/master/doc/README.org).

For deployment of GN2 on the webservers (penguin and penguin2), see
[penguins](./doc/gn2_on_penguin.org).

## Access

All machines are inside the UT network and can only be reached through
VPN from outside. The machines themselves have ssh access.
