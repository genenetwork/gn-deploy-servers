* Introduction

The webservers are named Penguin and Penguin2. On these servers GNU
Guix is running to manage software installation and GN2 deployment in
a controlled fashion. Generally the tools are installed under

: export PATH="/usr/local/guix-profiles/shared-profile/bin:/usr/local/guix-profiles/shared-profile/sbin":$PATH

* Installation

Currently tools are installed in the shared profile with the command:

#+begin_src sh
penguin2:~/genenetwork/gn-latest-guix$ ./pre-inst-env guix package \
  -p /usr/local/guix-profiles/shared-profile -i guix vim openssh mc ruby \
  pfff git lz4 strace curl mutt gdb valgrind --fallback
#+end_src sh

* ssh

ssh is installed by GNU Guix in /usr/local/guix-profiles/shared-profile/bin.
